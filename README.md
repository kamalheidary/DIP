digital image processing with matlab (gonzalez)

Here we have some codes for digital image processing using Matlab course. I wrote them about 4 years ago and now I would like to share them in git hub. But I can not remember what I wrote! :D

HW0201: Zoom
HW0202: Quantization
HW0203: Zoom unzoom

HW0301: Image display in gray level
HW0302: Histogram equalization
HW0303: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
HW0304: Statistic histogram enhance
HW0305: Smooth and median filter
HW0306: Laplacian filter

HW0401: Discrete Fourier Transform
HW0402: fftshift
HW0403: angle and phy
HW0404: Ideal Low Pass Filtering
HW0405: Butterworth Low Pass Filtering
HW0406: Gaussian Low Pass Filtering
